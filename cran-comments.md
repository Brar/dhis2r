## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Fixed the misspelled word in DESCRIPTION from Connet (8:14) to Connect

* In the DESCRIPTION I omitted the redundant "R" from your title. Just wrote : "Client for
the 'DHIS2' Web API".


## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs

## Downstream dependencies
There are currently no downstream dependencies for this package
